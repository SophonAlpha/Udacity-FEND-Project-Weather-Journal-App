# Project Weather Journal App
*Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program*

A simple app to get the weather temperature at a given zip code. The user can enter the zip code 
in web form. In addition, the user can submit a free text as personal notes. Submitted data is 
stored at the server side.

Project demonstrates development of server side and client side code. Use of open APIs to 
retrieve open data (https://openweathermap.org/). Use of asynchronous Java functions and 
dynamically updating HTML elements in the web user interface with data retrieved from the server.
